## About me

I am a PhD student in the Applied Data Mining research group at the University of Antwerp (Engineering Department), funded by the Flemish Research Fund (FWO). My PhD supervisor is [Prof. dr. ir. David Martens](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/personeel/david-martens/){:target="_blank"}. Currently, I am working on *Interpretable Classification Models built from High-dimensional, Sparse data*. More specifically, I am investigating post-hoc interpretation techniques for explaining model predictions made by classifiers built from huge-dimensional data, such as behavioral data (web browsing data, location data, transaction data, and so on) and textual data (online reviews, news articles, and so on). <br/> <br/> In my first research project, I have proposed two novel model-agnostic explanation algorithms for computing *counterfactual explanations* by aligning additive feature attribution explanation methods (such as [LIME](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938v1.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [SHAP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07874.pdf){:target="_blank"}) with the notion of counterfactuals. Counterfactual explanations are tailored to an individual prediction (i.e., they work on the instance level) and show a set of features such that when removing them, the predicted class changes. Martens & Provost (2013) have proposed a heuristic search algorithm [SEDC](pages.stern.nyu.edu/~fprovost/Papers/MartensProvost_Explaining.pdf){:target="_blank"} based on local improvement, originally in the context of explaining document classifications (find the open-source implementation [here](https://github.com/yramon/edc){:target="_blank"}). In this study, I have compared the efficiency and effectiveness of the two novel algorithms against the existing SEDC algorithm.

In 2018 (2016), I've obtained a Master's (Bachelor's) degree in Business Engineering (spec. Financial Engineering) from the University of Antwerp. As part of my Master's program, I studied at the Toulouse School of Management (TSM) during the Fall 2017 semester.
