## About me

I am a PhD student in the Applied Data Mining research group at the University of Antwerp (Engineering Department). My PhD supervisor is [Prof. dr. ir. David Martens](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/personeel/david-martens/). Currently, I am working on *Interpretable Classification Models built from High-dimensional, Sparse data*. More specifically, I am investigating post-hoc interpretation techniques for explaining model predictions made by classifiers built from huge-dimensional data, such as behavioral data (web browsing data, location data, transaction data, and so on) and textual data (online reviews, news articles, and so on). <br/> <br/> In my first research project, I have proposed two novel model-agnostic explanation algorithms for computing *counterfactual explanations* by aligning additive feature attribution explanation methods (such as [LIME](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938v1.pdf) and [SHAP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07874.pdf)) with the notion of counterfactuals. Counterfactual explanations are tailored to an individual prediction (i.e., they work on the instance level) and show a set of features such that when removing them, the predicted class changes. [Martens & Provost](pages.stern.nyu.edu/~fprovost/Papers/MartensProvost_Explaining.pdf) have proposed a heuristic search algorithm based on local improvement (called SEDC) in the context of high-dimensional data. In this study, I have compared the efficiency and effectiveness of the two novel algorithms against the existing SEDC algorithm. This paper is currently under review.
