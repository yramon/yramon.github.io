## About me

I am a Doctoral Researcher in the Applied Data Mining research group at the University of Antwerp (Engineering Department) (PhD fellowship granted by the [Research Foundation-Flanders](https://www.fwo.be/en/the-fwo/){:target="_blank"}). My PhD supervisor is [Prof. dr. ir. David Martens](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/personeel/david-martens/){:target="_blank"}. In my research, I am working on *Interpretable Classification Models built from High-dimensional, Sparse data*. More precisely, I am investigating interpretation techniques for explaining decisions of prediction models trained on ultra-high-dimensional data, like big "behavioral" data (web browsing data, location data, payments data, and so on) and textual data (online reviews, news articles, and so on). <br/> <br/> In my first research project, I have proposed two model-agnostic explanation algorithms for computing *counterfactual explanations* by aligning additive feature attribution explanation methods ([LIME](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938v1.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [SHAP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07874.pdf){:target="_blank"}) with the notion of counterfactuals. Counterfactual explanations are tailored to a single model decision and show a set of features such that, when removing them (setting their feature values to zero), the predicted class changes. For example, when predicting someone as a left-wing political voter from the web pages he visited, a counterfactual explanation shows the URLs that led to this classification. In other words, if the person would not have visited the web pages part of the counterfactual, the predicted political preference would be different. Martens & Provost (2013) have proposed a heuristic search algorithm [SEDC](pages.stern.nyu.edu/~fprovost/Papers/MartensProvost_Explaining.pdf){:target="_blank"} based on local improvement, originally in the context of explaining document classifications (find the open-source implementation [here](https://github.com/yramon/edc){:target="_blank"}). In this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01819){:target="_blank"}, I have compared the effectiveness and efficiency of the two novel algorithms against the existing SEDC algorithm. <br/> <br/> More recently, I've worked on global explanations for prediction models using so-called "metafeatures". We used rule-extraction as the global explanation model, where the goal is to extract a set of rules that mimic the decisions of the model, which we refer to as a "black-box", because its inner workings are not interpretable. "Metafeatures" are higher-level features that cluster fine-grained features: for example, Facebook pages can be grouped into categories (for example, "Fashion") or credit card transactions can be grouped into spending categories (for example, "Charity"). In this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04792){:target="_blank"}, we show that using metafeatures to approximate the behaviour of a prediction model on big data improves a key "cost of explainability", which we define as the loss in fidelity when replacing the "black-box" with an explainable model. We show how explanations using metafeatures are better at mimicking the underlying model compared to explanations using the fine-grained features, while also resulting in better tradeoffs between fidelity, stability, accuracy, and comprehensibility.

In 2018 (2016), I've obtained a Master's (Bachelor's) degree in Business Engineering (spec. Financial Engineering) from the University of Antwerp. As part of my Master's program, I studied at the Toulouse School of Management (TSM) during the Fall 2017 semester.
