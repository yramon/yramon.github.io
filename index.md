## About me

I am a Doctoral Researcher in Applied Data Mining at the University of Antwerp, having a PhD fellowship granted by the [Research Foundation-Flanders](https://www.fwo.be/en/the-fwo/){:target="_blank"}. My supervisor is [Prof. dr. ir. David Martens](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/personeel/david-martens/){:target="_blank"}. In my research, I work on *Explaining Prediction Models on Behavior and Text data*, and investigate methods for explaining decisions of prediction models that are trained on big data generated by humans on a daily basis, for example, web browsing data, GPS location data, payment data, social media data, and so on.

In 2018 (2016), I've obtained a Master's (Bachelor's) degree in Business Engineering (Financial Engineering) from the University of Antwerp (Belgium). As part of my Master's program, I studied at the Toulouse School of Management in France during the Fall 2017 semester.

## Research Portfolio

* **Explaining personality predictions from spending behavior.** The goal of this project is to gain insight into how personality traits can be inferred from spending records. This project is in collaboration with [Prof. Sandra Matz](https://sandramatz.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Robert Farrokhnia](https://ra.schlosser.io/){:target="_blank"}, both affiliated at Columbia University in New York City (USA). 

* **Gaining insight into black-box models on digital footprints using grouped features.** Worked on global explanations for prediction models using grouped features or "metafeatures". We used rule-extraction to extract a set of rules that mimic the decisions of the black-box model, of which the inner workings are not interpretable. Metafeatures are high-level features that cluster fine-grained features: for example, Facebook pages can be grouped into categories (e.g., "Fashion", "Data Science", "Entrepreneurship") and credit card transactions can be grouped into spending categories (e.g.,"Charity", "Coffee Shops"). In this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04792){:target="_blank"}, we show how explanations using metafeatures (e.g., spending categories) are better at mimicking the black-box model than explanations with the fine-grained features (e.g., millions of transactions used by the model). Also there exist important tradeoffs between fidelity, stability, accuracy, and the complexity of explanation rules that practicioners should be aware off. <br/>

* **Using LIME and SHAP to counterfactually explain model predictions.** Proposed two model-agnostic algorithms ([LIME-C](https://github.com/yramon/LimeCounterfactual){:target="_blank"} and [SHAP-C](https://github.com/yramon/ShapCounterfactual){:target="_blank"}) for computing counterfactual explanations by aligning additive feature attribution explanation methods with the notion of counterfactuals. Counterfactual explanations are tailored to a single model decision and show a set of features such that, when removing them (setting their values to zero), the predicted class changes. Read my KDNuggets [blogpost](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/05/evidence-counterfactuals-predictive-models-big-data.html){:target="_blank"} on counterfactual explanations. Martens & Provost (2013) proposed a heuristic algorithm [SEDC](pages.stern.nyu.edu/~fprovost/Papers/MartensProvost_Explaining.pdf){:target="_blank"} based on local improvement, originally in the context of explaining document classifications (find the open-source code [here](https://github.com/yramon/edc){:target="_blank"}). In this [paper](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11634-020-00418-3?sharing_token=S-ZlX5lQWJkpuxoiUPV8__e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY7sQ9KluI1KeELkdg_mEQicaoXaoohNECLfwgFaf3b6zksBL6ll0pEm465_TkCFlp7tmugduGTXK0-0enwdOxmDo5-DA0ru28xQcmK6soKgWU9rHQcx-QtJAJic3LSda-I%3D){:target="_blank"}, I compared the effectiveness and efficiency of the two novel algorithms against the SEDC algorithm, and found that LIME-C is a suitable alternative to SEDC, especially for data with large instances.
