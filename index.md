## About me

I'm working as a data science consultant at McKinsey & Company in Brussels. I've obtained experience in designing and implementing advanced analytics solutions, and worked on projects across different industries (like healthcare, retail and telecom) topics (like demand forecasting, and workforce optimization) and countries.

Prior to McKinsey, I've obtained my PhD in Data Science from the University of Antwerp (fellowship granted by the [Research Foundation-Flanders](https://www.fwo.be/en/the-fwo/){:target="_blank"}), with [Prof. David Martens](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/personeel/david-martens/){:target="_blank"} as my supervisor. In my research, I've contributed to the field of Explainable AI by developing new methods to explain black-box AI models that are trained on big human behavioral data (think of web browsing data, GPS locations, financial transactions, social media data,...).

## Research portfolio

* **Explaining personality predictions from consumer spending data (2021).** We connected financial spending records to personality traits, and show which transaction patterns are most predictive for certain traits. This project was in collaboration with [Prof. Sandra Matz](https://sandramatz.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Robert Farrokhnia](https://ra.schlosser.io/){:target="_blank"}, both affiliated at Columbia University.

* **Understanding preferences for explanations generated by XAI algorithms (2021).** We studied people's preferences for explanations of algorithmic decisions. We focused on three main attributes that describe automatically-generated explanations from existing XAI algorithms (format, complexity, and specificity), and capture differences across contexts (advertising vs. loan applications) and users' cognitive styles. We found that counterfactual explanations are not popular among users, unless they follow a negative outcome (e.g., loan application was denied). We also found that users are willing to tolerate some complexity in explanations. Finally, our results suggest that preferences for specific (vs. more abstract) explanations are related to the level at which the decision is construed by the user, and to the deliberateness of the user's cognitive style.

* **Gaining insight into prediction models using grouped features (2021).** We proposed a novel technique to extract global explanations for prediction models using grouped features or "metafeatures". The technique uses rule-extraction to extract a set of rules that mimic the decisions of the black-box model, of which the inner workings are not interpretable. Metafeatures are high-level features that cluster fine-grained features: for example, Facebook pages can be grouped into categories (e.g., "Fashion", "Data Science") and credit card transactions can be grouped into spending categories (e.g., "Coffee Shops"). A key finding of [our study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-021-05981-0#citeas){:target="_blank"} is that explanation rules with metafeatures (e.g., spending categories) are better at mimicking the black-box than explanation rules extracted with the original behavioral features (e.g., millions of possible financial transactions).

* **Using LIME and SHAP to counterfactually explain model predictions (2020).** We developed novel algorithms ([LIME-C](https://github.com/yramon/LimeCounterfactual){:target="_blank"} and [SHAP-C](https://github.com/yramon/ShapCounterfactual){:target="_blank"}) for computing counterfactual explanations by aligning additive feature attribution explanation methods with the notion of counterfactuals. Counterfactual explanations are tailored to a single model decision and show a set of features such that, when removing them (setting their values to zero), the predicted class changes. (Read my KDNuggets blogpost on counterfactual explanations [here](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/05/evidence-counterfactuals-predictive-models-big-data.html){:target="_blank"}.) Martens & Provost (2013) proposed a heuristic algorithm [SEDC](pages.stern.nyu.edu/~fprovost/Papers/MartensProvost_Explaining.pdf){:target="_blank"} based on local improvement, originally in the context of explaining document classifications (open-source code [here](https://github.com/yramon/edc){:target="_blank"}). In this [paper](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11634-020-00418-3?sharing_token=S-ZlX5lQWJkpuxoiUPV8__e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY7sQ9KluI1KeELkdg_mEQicaoXaoohNECLfwgFaf3b6zksBL6ll0pEm465_TkCFlp7tmugduGTXK0-0enwdOxmDo5-DA0ru28xQcmK6soKgWU9rHQcx-QtJAJic3LSda-I%3D){:target="_blank"}, I compared the effectiveness and efficiency of the two novel algorithms against the SEDC algorithm, and found that LIME-C is a suitable alternative to SEDC, especially for data with large instances.
